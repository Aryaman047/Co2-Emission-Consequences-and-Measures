# CO2 EFFECTS,CONSEQUENCES AND MEASURES



Global GDP and CO2 emissions are two interconnected aspects of the global economy that have significant effects and consequences on the environment. The growth of global GDP has been a driving force behind the increase in carbon emissions, which in turn have had severe consequences for the environment, including global warming, climate change, and environmental degradation. This essay will explore the correlation between global GDP and CO2 emissions, the effects and consequences of high CO2 emissions, and the measures that can be taken to mitigate these effects.

The correlation between global GDP and CO2 emissions is clear. As countries become more industrialized and their economies grow, the demand for energy increases, leading to an increase in carbon emissions. According to the World Bank, the global GDP has increased from $42.2 trillion in 1990 to $87.7 trillion in 2019. This significant increase in the global GDP has led to an increase in carbon emissions, which have risen from 22.9 billion metric tons in 1990 to 36.4 billion metric tons in 2019.

The effects and consequences of high CO2 emissions are numerous and severe. One of the most significant effects is global warming, which occurs when the earth's atmosphere traps heat, leading to a rise in temperatures. This rise in temperatures has led to melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and more frequent natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Additionally, high CO2 emissions have led to ocean acidification, which has had disastrous effects on marine life, including coral reefs and shellfish.

To mitigate the effects of high CO2 emissions, several measures can be taken. One of the most effective measures is the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, countries can significantly reduce their carbon emissions. Additionally, energy-efficient technologies such as LED lighting and insulation can help reduce energy consumption, leading to a reduction in carbon emissions. Finally, policies such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems can provide financial incentives for companies to reduce their carbon emissions.

In conclusion, the correlation between global GDP and CO2 emissions is clear, with the growth of the global economy leading to an increase in carbon emissions. The effects and consequences of high CO2 emissions are severe, including global warming, climate change, and environmental degradation. However, measures can be taken to mitigate the effects of high CO2 emissions, including the adoption of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient technologies, and policy measures such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems. By taking these measures, countries can reduce their carbon emissions and minimize the negative impacts of global warming and climate change on the environment.


Through this visualisation we tend to depict and present statistics in an animated way for the researchers to learn and interest the audience.
