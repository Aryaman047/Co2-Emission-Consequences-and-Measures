      <p> <strong> Data visualization that depicts the growing GDP, CO2 emissions increase with GDP, its deaths and investments in renewable energy that are improving the condition would show a complex relationship between these factors. The visualization could show how as GDP increases, CO2 emissions also increase. However, with increased investments in renewable energy, the rate of CO2 emissions growth could slow down. This could be shown through a line graph or a scatter plot with multiple trend lines. </strong></p>
      <p><strong> The correlation among these factors is complex. While there is a positive correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions, there is also a negative correlation between investments in renewable energy and CO2 emissions. As investments in renewable energy increase, CO2 emissions decrease. This suggests that while economic growth can lead to increased CO2 emissions, investments in renewable energy can mitigate this effect. </strong></p>

    <h1>GDP AND IT'S FACTORS</h1>
    <p>The global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of goods and services produced by all countries in the world. It is an important indicator of the health of the global economy and is influenced by a variety of factors, both positive and negative.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Causes for Rise:</strong> The following are some of the factors that contribute to the rise of global GDP: <ul> <li>Increased productivity and technological advancements in various industries</li> <li>Higher levels of international trade and investment</li> <li>Population growth and increased consumer spending</li> <li>Government policies that promote economic growth, such as tax incentives and infrastructure development</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Causes for Fall:</strong> The following are some of the factors that contribute to the fall of global GDP: <ul> <li>Natural disasters and other external shocks that disrupt production and supply chains</li> <li>Global economic downturns and recessions</li> <li>Political instability and conflict, which can deter foreign investment and trade</li> <li>Trade wars and protectionist policies that limit international trade and investment</li> </ul> </li> </ol></p>

	<h2>CO2 Emission(Metric Ton per Capita)</h2>
	<p>CO2 emissions, measured in metric tons per capita, are an important measure of a country's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. Here is a brief overview of the changes in CO2 emissions over the years:</p><ol> <li><strong>1950s-1970s:</strong> CO2 emissions were relatively stable during this period, with most countries emitting less than 5 metric tons per capita.</li> <li><strong>1980s:</strong> CO2 emissions started to increase rapidly during this decade, particularly in developed countries. The global average rose to around 6 metric tons per capita.</li> <li><strong>1990s-2000s:</strong> Emissions continued to rise during this period, with the global average reaching around 7 metric tons per capita.</li> <li><strong>2010s:</strong> In the last decade, there has been a slight decrease in CO2 emissions in some countries due to increased awareness and efforts to reduce emissions. However, the global average still stands at around 7 metric tons per capita.</li></ol>

  <p>It is important to note that while some countries have made significant progress in reducing CO2 emissions, others continue to emit at high levels. This highlights the need for continued efforts to address the issue of climate change on a global scale.</p>

	<h2>Infant Deaths Due to Respiratory (primarily pollution) Diseases</h2>

  <p><strong>Children Deaths Due to Pollution Throughout the Years</strong></p><ol> <li>According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), around 1.7 million children under the age of 5 die each year due to environmental risks, including pollution.</li> <li>Air pollution is one of the biggest culprits, with fine particulate matter from sources such as factories, vehicles, and burning of fossil fuels causing respiratory diseases and other health problems in children.</li> <li>In developing countries, indoor pollution from cooking with solid fuels like wood and charcoal is a major cause of childhood deaths.</li> <li>In addition to respiratory illnesses, pollution has been linked to other health problems in children, such as increased risk of low birth weight, cognitive delays, and even cancer.</li> <li>Efforts to reduce pollution and its impact on children's health include promoting clean energy sources, improving indoor air quality, and reducing emissions from transportation and industry.</li></ol>


	<h2>Deaths due to Air Pollution : Different Causes</h2>
	<p><strong>Air Pollution Deaths Due to Different Sources</strong></p><ol> <li><strong>Environmental Air Pollution:</strong> Outdoor air pollution caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This includes deaths from heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and respiratory illnesses. Sources of environmental air pollution include industrial emissions, transportation, and burning of fossil fuels.</li> <li><strong>Household Air Pollution:</strong> Indoor air pollution from sources such as cooking with solid fuels like wood, charcoal, and dung contributes to an estimated 3.8 million deaths each year, mostly in developing countries. This type of pollution can cause respiratory infections, heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer.</li> <li><strong>Ambient Ozone Pollution:</strong> Ozone pollution, which is formed when emissions from vehicles and industrial sources react with sunlight, can cause respiratory problems and increase the risk of premature death. In 2016, ambient ozone pollution was responsible for an estimated 200,000 premature deaths worldwide.</li> <li><strong>Particulate Pollution:</strong> Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, is a type of air pollution that can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems. In 2016, it was responsible for an estimated 3 million premature deaths worldwide. Sources of particulate pollution include burning of fossil fuels, transportation, and industrial emissions.</li></ol>

	<h2>The Global Carbon Project</h2>
	<p><strong>The Global Carbon Budget</strong></p><ol> <li>The Global Carbon Project (GCP) is an organization that integrates knowledge of greenhouse gases for human activities and the Earth system. Established in 2001, its projects include global budgets for three dominant greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide — and complementary efforts in urban, regional, cumulative, and negative emissions. The main objective of the group is to fully understand the carbon cycle.. The Global Carbon Budget is a yearly report produced by the Global Carbon Project that provides an overview of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.</li> <li>The report includes data on the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases from human activities, such as burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, as well as natural sources such as wildfires and volcanic activity.</li> <li>The Global Carbon Budget also tracks the uptake of carbon by the land and ocean sinks, which help to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases on the climate.</li> <li>The report provides insights into the trends and drivers of global greenhouse gas emissions and helps to inform policy decisions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</li> <li>The latest Global Carbon Budget report, released in 2020, showed that global CO2 emissions had decreased slightly in 2019, but were still at a historically high level. The report also highlighted the need for urgent action to reduce emissions in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed in the Paris Agreement.</li></ol>



  <h2>Investment Index in Renewable Energy</h2>
  <p><strong>Investments in Renewable Energy in Different Sectors</strong></p><ol> <li><strong>Electricity Generation:</strong> The electricity generation sector has seen significant investments in renewable energy in recent years. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable electricity capacity grew at its fastest pace in two decades in 2020, with solar and wind energy leading the way. In 2019, renewable energy investments in the electricity sector reached a record high of $304.9 billion.</li> <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> The transportation sector is also seeing increasing investments in renewable energy, particularly in the form of electric vehicles (EVs) and associated infrastructure.
